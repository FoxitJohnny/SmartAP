# SmartAP Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* **Be Respectful:** Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* **Be Constructive:** Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* **Be Accountable:** Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* **Be Collaborative:** Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Be Professional:** Using welcoming and inclusive language

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Doxxing or revealing someone's identity without consent
* Sustained disruption of community discussions or events
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Spam, advertising, or off-topic content in community channels

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official e-mail address (e.g., @smartap.io)
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Participating in GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions
* Engaging in Discord channels or other community forums

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** conduct@smartap.io

**GitHub:** Open a private security advisory at https://github.com/FoxitJohnny/SmartAP/security/advisories/new

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting an incident, please include:

* Your contact information (so we can follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Description of the incident
* If you believe the incident is ongoing
* Any additional information that may be helpful
* Screenshots or links to relevant content (if applicable)

### What Happens After You Report

1. **Acknowledgment:** You will receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours
2. **Investigation:** The report will be reviewed by community leaders
3. **Decision:** A decision will be made based on the severity and context
4. **Action:** Appropriate action will be taken (see Enforcement Guidelines)
5. **Follow-up:** You will be informed of the outcome

## Response Timeline

| Severity | Initial Response | Resolution Target |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Critical (harassment, threats) | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| High (repeated violations) | 24 hours | 72 hours |
| Medium (single incident) | 48 hours | 1 week |
| Low (minor issues) | 72 hours | 2 weeks |

## Appeal Process

If you believe a moderation decision was made in error, you may appeal by:

1. Sending an email to appeals@smartap.io
2. Clearly stating why you believe the decision was incorrect
3. Providing any additional context or evidence

Appeals will be reviewed by a different community leader than the one who made
the original decision. The appeal decision is final.

## Community Guidelines for Contributors

### GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

* **Search First:** Before opening an issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates
* **Be Specific:** Provide clear, detailed descriptions of bugs or feature requests
* **Be Patient:** Maintainers review issues when time permits; avoid pinging repeatedly
* **Stay On Topic:** Keep discussions focused on the issue at hand
* **Accept Feedback:** Be open to suggestions for improving your contributions

### Discord and Community Chat

* **Use Appropriate Channels:** Post questions in #support, discussions in #general
* **No Self-Promotion:** Don't spam links to your own projects without context
* **Help Others:** If you see a question you can answer, please do!
* **Be Kind:** Remember there's a human behind every message

### Code Review Etiquette

**For Reviewers:**
* Be constructive and specific in feedback
* Explain the "why" behind suggestions
* Acknowledge good work, not just problems
* Use "consider" or "suggestion" for non-blocking comments

**For Authors:**
* Respond to all comments, even with a simple "done"
* Ask for clarification if feedback is unclear
